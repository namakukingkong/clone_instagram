  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  # storage :file

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  # process :scale => [200, 300]

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :medium do
    process resize_to_limit: [640, 640]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:

  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
